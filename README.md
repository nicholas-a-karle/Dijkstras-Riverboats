## Compilation
    Compile as you would any Java program

## Runtime Use
    Across the top there are 4 controls
    Going left to right: 
    First is a number box, which controls the dimensions of the adjacency matrix of the graph (NxN)
    Second is a button labeled "Pathfind," which will print the results of Dijkstra's algorithm to 3 forms of output
    Third is a button labeled "Load File," which will load adjacency matrix entries from a file in the form of
    (Number of Nodes)
    (Adjacency Matrix Entry)(Whitespace)
    Fourth is a button labeled "Select File," which will select/create the output file

    Above the adjacency matrix are three checkboxes which indicate how the files meaning and default values of number boxes will be decided

    Then there is a representation of the adjacency matrix with edittable number boxes

    On the right side is one form of output

    The three forms of output are:
        1. To file (default is output.txt)
        2. To Console (System.out)
        3. To Frame (left side of screen)
